---Overall Observation and insights---

1. Strong correlation between Size and Rent
    -Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.95 between apartment size and rent, 
    indicating a very strong positive linear relationship.
    -Larger apartments almost always cost more, confirming size as the most 
    influential feature for predicting rent.

2.Moderate correlation between bedrooms and Rent
    -Correlation between number of bedrooms and rent is about 0.68, suggesting 
    that while the number of rooms matters, it is less impactful than size.
    -It may act as a supporting feature rather than a primary driver.

3.Location Greatly Affects Rent Prices
    -Even for apartments of similar size, the rent varies across cities:
        *Kolkata, Ahmedabad, and Chennai consistently show higher rents.
        *Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Pune show relatively affordable options.
    -This confirms that location acts as a categorical multiplier on rent pricing.

4.Linear Trend Across Cities
    -The scatter plot (Size vs Rent) shows a consistent upward trend across all cities, 
    supporting the use of a linear regression model.
    -Most data points lie along a diagonal line, strengthening confidence in the model.

5.Outliers and Premium Properties
    -A few apartments, especially those over 1600â€“1800 sq.ft, show disproportionately high rents, possibly due to:
        -Premium locations
        -Luxurious furnishing
        -Added amenities
    -These outliers should be handled carefully in model training to avoid bias.


--Conclusion
1.Apartment size is the most important predictor of rent.
2.Location adds significant variance and must be encoded properly.
3.A simple linear regression will work well as a baseline, and can be improved with more features or interaction terms.
